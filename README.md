# CondensatesDynamicsML
VAMPNet application in deep learning analysis of binding peptides to condensates.

I use [VAMPnet](https://github.com/markovmodel/deeptime/tree/master/vampnet) open source Python package to detect binding events in condensate-peptide problem. The daatset was simulated with HOOMD.
