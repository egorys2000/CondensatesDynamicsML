# CondensatesDynamicsML
VAMPNet application in deep learning analysis of binding peptides to condensates.

I use [VAMPnet](https://github.com/markovmodel/deeptime/tree/master/vampnet) open source Python package to detect binding events in condensate-peptide problem. The dataset was simulated with HOOMD.

# Preparations
Create the conda environment from the tfenv.yml file with the following commands:

```
conda env create -f tfenv.yml
conda activate tfenv
```

# Usage
To test on test-data, launch Protein_condensate_model_training.ipynb and launch all cells above the **"Run several model iterations saving the best one, to help finding sparcely populated states"** section. To train current model, launch that section. To load weights, run **"Recover the saved model and its training history"** section. To get model output, run
```
temp = model.predict([traj_ord, traj_ord_lag], batch_size=np.shape(X1_vali)[0])
```

# Dataset
The data was simulated with HOOMD-blue package. The pipeline was the following:  
Simulate the formation of ctd condensate ->  
Add peptide chain (E10/P10 in test data) ->  
Run simulation to get binding events ->  
Process .dcd files to .npy and plug into neural network.  

The simulation script, topology file and other model parameters are in *hoomd* folder.
