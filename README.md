# CondensatesDynamicsML
VAMPNet application in deep learning analysis of binding peptides to condensates.

I use [VAMPnet](https://github.com/markovmodel/deeptime/tree/master/vampnet) open source Python package to detect binding events in condensate-peptide problem. The dataset was simulated with HOOMD.

# Preparations
Create the conda environment from the tfenv.yml file with the following commands:

```
conda env create -f tfenv.yml
conda activate tfenv
```

# Usage
To test on test-data, launch Protein_condensate_model_training.ipynb and launch all cells above the "Run several model iterations saving the best one, to help finding sparcely populated states" section. To train current model, launch that section. To load weights, run "Recover the saved model and its training history" section. To get model output, run
```
temp = model.predict([traj_ord, traj_ord_lag], batch_size=np.shape(X1_vali)[0])
```
